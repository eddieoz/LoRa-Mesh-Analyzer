# Configuration for Meshtastic Network Monitor

# # List of Node IDs to prioritize for active testing (Traceroute, etc.)
# # If priority nodes is enabled, then only those nodes will be tested. 
# # If this session is disabled, then auto discovery will run automatically
# # Format: "!<NodeID>"
# priority_nodes:
  # - "!12345678" 

# Logging Level [warn|info|debug]

# Auto-Discovery Settings (Used if priority_nodes is empty)
# Analysis Mode: 'distance' (default) or 'router_clusters'

# Radius for router cluster analysis (nodes close to routers in meters). 
# Only used if analysis_mode is 'router_clusters'
